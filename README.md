## Description

this was my first coding assignment. We were given a choice to pick one out of 3 topics to make a static webpage out of.
i choose to make rainydays, which is a web shop that sells jackets.  The site is made purely of CSS and HTML.

the site contains the following pages:
- Home
- Products
- About
- Contact
- Cart
- Checkout
- Checkout complete

Since this was my first project, i had a lot of trouble getting elements where i wanted them to be. This was especialy true
with the mobile navbar. i choose to make that in a "app" kind of way, which is untraditional, but fun. eache page has a parralax in header
that makes a nice effect.

all in all i learned a lot from this project.
